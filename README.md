# Socioeconomic and Health Determinants of Maternal Outcomes: A County-Level Analysis for Pregnancy Support Services
This project delivers data-driven insights on maternal health and socioeconomic factors on birth outcomes to highlight and uncover business potentials in opportunistic regions.

## Background and Objectives

Maternal health is crucial for the well-being of mothers and their newborns. Disparities in access to healthcare, socioeconomic resources, and support services can impact pregnancy outcomes across regions. This project identifies counties where pregnant women face higher risks due to poor maternal health, limited prenatal care, and economic hardships.

Key metrics include:
- **Pre-pregnancy BMI**
- **Average birth weight**
- **Prenatal care access**
- **Socioeconomic indicators (income levels, employment rates)**

The goal is to guide interventions for developing support programs to improve maternal care and pregnancy outcomes in underserved communities.

## Key Insights and Recommendations

### 1. Maternal Health Metrics Analysis

Factors influencing pregnancy outcomes include:
- **Pre-pregnancy BMI**: In 98.6% of counties, the average BMI is above 25, with Sumter County, SC having the highest average (29.4).
- **Average Birth Weight**: The average birth weight is 3.27kg, with Whatcom, WA having the highest and Hinds, MS the lowest.
- **Prenatal Visits**: On average, mothers receive 11.4 weeks of prenatal care, with significant variation across counties.

### 2. Health and Socioeconomic Correlations

- **Pre-pregnancy BMI**: Counties with higher income levels tend to have lower BMI.
- **Birth Weight**: Socioeconomic factors show minimal correlation with birth weight, while gestational age is a stronger determinant.
- **Prenatal Care**: Prenatal care duration shows a weak correlation with socioeconomic factors.

### 3. Recommendations

- Focus on **BMI management** for counties with overweight mothers.
- Tailor health interventions for **younger maternal populations**.
- Promote **prenatal care programs** to encourage early and regular check-ups.
- Partner with healthcare providers for **referral programs** and community health workshops.
- Implement a **monitoring system** to track the effectiveness of interventions.

## Data Structure

The analysis was conducted on a dataset merged from two tables: `county_natality.csv` and `FIPS_socioeconomic.csv`, with a final merged table `Merged_Natality_FIPS.csv` used for SQL and Excel analysis.
