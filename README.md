# Socioeconomic and Health Determinants of Maternal Outcomes: A County-Level Analysis for Pregnancy Support Services
This project delivers data-driven insights on maternal health and socioeconomic factors on birth outcomes to highlight and uncover business potentials in opportunistic regions.

## Background and Objectives

Maternal health is a critical factor that influences the well-being of both mothers and their 
new-borns. However, disparities in access to healthcare, socioeconomic resources, and 
support services can significantly impact pregnancy outcomes across different regions. This 
project focuses on identifying counties where pregnant women face higher risks due to 
factors like poor maternal health, limited prenatal care, and economic hardships.
Utilizing key metrics such as pre-pregnancy BMI, average birth weight, prenatal care access, 
and socioeconomic indicators like income levels and employment rates, this project seeks to 
pinpoint areas where support is most needed. The goal is to guide interventions to help 
develop targeted support programs that improve maternal care and pregnancy outcomes in 
underserved communities, ensuring healthier pregnancies and stronger maternal health 
services.
This project serves as a foundational step toward developing a business aimed at providing 
holistic and tailored support services to pregnant women, ensuring that they receive the 
necessary care and assistance to foster healthier pregnancies and, by extension, healthier 
communities.
These are the key areas that provide insights and recommendations:

### Project Focus:
- **Maternal Health Metrics Analysis:**
  Examination of factors influencing pregnancy outcomes like maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, average birth weight, and access to prenatal care. Identifying health and trends like low birth weight helps target regions needing improved healthcare services and maternal support
- **Health and Socioeconomic Correlations:**
  Examining how health metrics and socioeconomic conditions interact to affect birth outcomes. These correlations can provide insights into regions which may need improvements.
  
The goal is to guide interventions and develop targeted support programs that improve maternal care and outcomes in underserved communities.

## Executive Summary 

### Overview of findings
Findings reveals that maternal health outcomes, such as pre-pregnancy BMI and birth weight, 
are primarily influenced by gestational age and maternal age, with socioeconomic factors 
play a secondary role. While wealthier counties tend to have lower BMI levels, socioeconomic 
factors show only minor correlations with birth weight. Gestational age consistently emerges 
as the strongest determinant of birth weight. Prenatal care access also varies across counties, 
and while its influence on birth weight is moderate, improving healthcare infrastructure and 
education in lower-income areas is essential for better outcomes. Overall, gestational factors 
and healthcare access are key drivers of maternal and infant health, with economic 
conditions plays a supporting role. These insights can inform targeted strategies to enhance 
maternal health and improve birth outcomes.

### 1. Maternal Health Metrics Analysis
**Overview:** The analysis reveals that maternal age, gestational age, and prenatal care are key 
factors affecting maternal health and birth outcomes. Older maternal age is linked to lower 
pre-pregnancy BMI, while longer gestational periods strongly correlate with higher birth 
weights. Although prenatal care weeks vary significantly across counties, their impact on 
birth weight is moderate but important. Overall, gestational age plays the most significant 
role in birth outcomes, while prenatal care access is crucial in supporting healthier 
pregnancies. These insights can inform targeted strategies to enhance maternal health and 
improve birth outcomes.
Key Findings:
- **Pre-Pregnancy BMI**: In the analyzed counties, 566 (98.6%) have an average pre-pregnancy BMI above 25.0, indicating overweight status, with Sumter County, SC, having the highest at 29.4. A strong negative correlation (r = -0.691) exists between average age and BMI, showing that older populations tend to have lower BMIs. Moderate negative correlations were also found between gestational age measures and BMI (r = -0.423 for Obstetric Estimation and r = -0.321 for Last Menstrual Period), indicating that lower BMIs are linked to more mature pregnancies. These findings underscore the need for interventions targeting obesity in younger demographics.
- **Average Birth Weight**: The average birth weight is 3.27 kg (7.22 lbs), declining by -0.16% from 2016 to 2018. Whatcom, WA, has the highest average birth weight, 4.3% above the national average, while Hinds, MS, is 7.2% below. Key factors influencing birth weight include strong negative correlations with gestational age (r = -0.741 for Obstetric Estimation and r = -0.711 for Last Menstrual Period), indicating that longer pregnancies lead to heavier babies. Maternal age also has a moderate negative correlation (r = -0.374) with birth weight, while the link between maternal BMI and birth weight is weak (r = -0.224).
- **Prenatal Visits**: On average, mothers receive 11.4 weeks of prenatal care, but this varies significantly, with Nueces County, TX, having the lowest at just 2.5 weeks, 22% below the national average. There is a moderate correlation between the number of prenatal visits and birth weight (r = -0.325), indicating that while prenatal care impacts birth weight, its influence is modest compared to stronger factors like gestational age and more significant than socioeconomic factors.

### 2. Socioeconomic and Health Correlations
**Overview:** Examining the relationship between economic conditions and maternal health 
shows that income levels play a notable role in shaping health outcomes. Counties with 
higher net earnings and per capita income tend to have lower pre-pregnancy BMI averages, 
indicating that stronger financial resources are linked to healthier maternal weight levels. On 
the other hand, socioeconomic factors have only a minor influence on birth weight, with 
weak correlations suggesting that gestational factors are far more critical in determining a 
babyâ€™s birth weight than economic status alone.

Key Findings:
- **BMI and Income**: Counties with higher income levels tend to have lower BMI (e.g., Sumter County, SC has one of the highest BMI averages).
- **Birth Weight and Gestational Age**: A strong correlation between gestational age and birth weight was found (r = 0.74), indicating longer pregnancies result in heavier babies.
- **Prenatal Care and Socioeconomic Status**: Prenatal care access shows a weak correlation with income, meaning that healthcare access is a more significant driver of prenatal care weeks.

### 3. Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:

- **BMI Management Programs**: Target counties with high average BMI (like Sumter County, SC) with fitness and nutrition programs to help lower BMI and reduce pregnancy-related risks.
- **Health Interventions for Younger Mothers**: Counties with younger maternal populations can benefit from tailored health programs focusing on BMI and prenatal care.
- **Prenatal Care Awareness Campaigns**: Increase awareness and access to prenatal care in counties with low birth weight (e.g., Hinds County, MS, and Bibb County, GA).
- **Partnership with Healthcare Providers**: Collaborate with local healthcare providers to offer prenatal workshops and community health events, creating referral programs that improve access to care.
- **Monitoring System**: Implement a feedback system to track the success of these interventions and adjust as necessary based on ongoing data analysis.

## Data Structure

The analysis uses a merged dataset from two tables: `county_natality.csv` and `FIPS_socioeconomic.csv`, resulting in the final table `Merged_Natality_FIPS.csv` with 1,722 rows. This table was used for both SQL and Excel analysis.
